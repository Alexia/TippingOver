 *           * $wgtoParsePageTitle set to TO_DO_LATE with no valid empty page name tooltip unless 
 *             $wgAssumeNonemptyPageTitle is set to true (but see risks with that setting),

 *           * $wgtoCategoryFiltering set to TO_DO_LATE under any circumstance.
 * 
 *       In these configurations, TippingOver does not know if there is a tooltip to show when a user hovers over a link
 *       and sends a request just to determine if it makes sense to show the loading tooltip first, and if so, it then 
 *       sends a separate request to actually load the tooltip. This avoids showing a loading tooltip that just 
 *       disappears, but the loading tooltip itself will be delayed in showing up and tooltips themselves will load more 
 *       slowly.
